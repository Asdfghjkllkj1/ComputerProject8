# ComputerProject8
A repository to save progress on my 8th grade computer project (mainly to sync files between laptop and desktop)  
## Usage of different branches  
Public - where releases ready for the public (or the computer class) are put out  
Development - where releases not quite ready for the public (or the computer class) and where added features usually go. Once it's ready for release, changes are merged onto public.  
## Backup Project  
See Backup Project folder for new README  
# Usage (executing code)
Download the code, then run index.html. After v0.0.06pre-alpha, there isn't a compatibility issue.
