# ComputerProject8
A repository to save progress on my 8th grade computer project (mainly to sync files between laptop and desktop)  
## Usage of different branches  
Public - where releases ready for the public (or the computer class) are put out  
Development - where releases not quite ready for the public (or the computer class) and where added features usually go. Once it's ready for release, changes are merged onto public.
