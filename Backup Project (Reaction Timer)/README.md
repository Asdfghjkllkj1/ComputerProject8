# Backup Project
Just in case I don't finish the main project, I made a backup project.  
The main goal: to make a reaction timer, with some requirements, in the least amount of code as possible.  
## Requirements
Must start with a fully green screen which doesn't track any user input.  
At a random time (can't be instant), screen must switch to red and stay red for the rest of execution.  
During the red screen time, the user can click, in which case the time elapsed (in seconds) after the screen switch is displayed to the user.
