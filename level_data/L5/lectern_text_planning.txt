Victorious warriors win first and thEn go to war, while defeated warrioRs GO to war first and theN seek to wiN.
All men can see these tactics whereby i conquer, but what none can see is the strateGy out of whIch Victory is Evolved.
regard YOUr soldiers as your children, and they will follow yoU into the deePest valleys.
